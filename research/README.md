# Research

Experiments that didn't make it to `src/` yet, most likely not even implemented in Rust.

Currently:

- An experiment into parsing FL Studio project files, as an alternative to a MIDI export of a project, which is quite cumbersome to do in FL Studio and obviously gives less information (such as no automation data, for example)
